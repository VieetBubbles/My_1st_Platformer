## 2 Week Game Project: Villager Vick

## Description
My personal graduation project in order to fulfill the prerequisite for completing the 1st year at Holberton School. The task was to -either by myself or with a group- create a workable software application from what we've learnt from the entire year. The rules didn't limit us to rely on just the school's framework and teachings but we were encourage to learn new program languages and use unknown software applications to create our project.

As such, this is project was my 1st time using Unity, Visual Studio(IDE), and the C# programming language.

Villager Vick is a 2D Pixel Platformer game created using the Unity game engine. The goal of the game is finish 3 levels of increasing difficulties by running pass and avoiding enemy sprites until the player reaches the finish line.

## Disclaimer
Initially, the 2 week project was completed and submitted for grading without a README.md attached. This README.md file was added at a later date for reference purposes. If future recruiters see this disclaimer... let it be known that during the final days of the project, I made the self-conscious decision to push the game's packages to Github without the need to write a README.md; my reasoning was the belief that a fixing the bugs and typos of the game took precedence over the README documentation. It is a decision I take responsibility for and will not refute.

## Compatibility/Specifications
The game was made with Unity (Version 2019.2.6fl) on a Macbook Air.

It's recommended you download either the previous version of Unity or the lastest version if you want to test the game out.

The game's files should work on both a PC or Mac, so long as you have the Unity Game Engine app installed on your computer.

Storage Requirements: 83.9MB
